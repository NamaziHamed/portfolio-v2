        I began my journey as a web developer and content creator in 2018,
        working independently with clients across various industries. During
        this time, I honed my skills in front-end technologies like <i>HTML</i>, <i>CSS</i>
        , <i>JavaScript</i>, <i>React</i>, and <i>Next.js</i>, while
        also gaining experience with back-end tools such as Node.js, Express,
        and SQL-based databases. My freelance work involved building responsive
        websites, optimizing performance, and delivering clean, maintainable
        code tailored to client needs.

      <p className="subtitle">
        Prior to that, I completed a two-year internship in R&D between 2016 and
        2018, where I contributed to multiple internal tools and learned how to
        collaborate effectively within a team. This role laid the foundation for
        my problem-solving mindset and attention to detail.

      <p className="subtitle">
        Throughout my experience, I’ve consistently focused on writing scalable
        code, learning new technologies, and developing user-friendly
        applications. My diverse background—spanning individual projects to
        team-based environments—has equipped me to adapt quickly and tackle
        real-world challenges with confidence.
